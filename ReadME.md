Hello world.
This is a project named Voters Registration system. 
Project duration: 23/06/2025 - 29/06/2025

This system allows new voters to register by submitting personal details. Admins can view, search, and manage the voter records. It can be built as a console app, desktop app, or a web app â€” we'll start with a console or desktop version using Python to focus on the logic, then you can later convert it to a web app with Flask.

I am now thinking of using django instead of flask.

1. Register New Voter
2. View All Voters
3. Search Voter by ID
4. Update Voter Info
5. Delete Voter
6. Exit

these above are the features of the app
